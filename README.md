## Skills

#### Communication 
Throughout my previous job and during my time at Makers communication has been key. In my previous job it was essential to converse with both retailers and customers from around the world and at Makers when collaborating with my fellow team members, communication was key. Thus I have the ability to connect with people on a professional level.  

#### Professional 
In my previous job, my role involved communicating with both retailers and customers around the world. Especially with the online second hand shop, selling used saddle parts. A customer would either phone up or email in and I would have to lease with the CEO of the company to find out if we had the required items available and then update the customer in a timely manor.
